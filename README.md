## Privacy & Security

This extension prioritizes your privacy:

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Data Location** | All data stays on your machine |
| **Network Calls** | None — fully offline operation |
| **Telemetry** | None — zero tracking or analytics |
| **Free Forever** | Always free to use; source is not distributed to prevent repackaging and resale |

**Data Sources:**
- `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` — Token usage and model statistics (Claude Code's rolling 30-day window, updated periodically by Claude Code)
- `~/.claude/analytics.db` — SQLite database preserving your full usage history (managed by this extension)
- `~/.claude/conversation-stats-cache.json` — Personality and code stats (updated by backfill script)
- `~/.claude/projects/*/` — Conversation history for personality analysis and real-time today's cost
- `~/.claude/.credentials.json` — Subscription tier information (read-only)

> **Note**: Today's stats may show $0.00 if Claude Code hasn't updated its cache yet. End your session or wait for the automatic cache update to see current data.

---

## Data & History

### Initial Data Window

When you first install the extension, your "Local History" stats will only include data from Claude Code's cache file—typically the **last ~30 days**. This is because Claude Code maintains a rolling window and doesn't preserve older data.

### Automatic History Accumulation

Once installed, the extension automatically saves your usage data to a local SQLite database (`~/.claude/analytics.db`). **From this point forward, your history is preserved forever**—even as Claude Code's cache rolls over.

Over time, your "Local History" totals will grow to include months or years of usage data.

### Managing History

Use the **"Claude Analytics: Clear History Before Date"** command to remove old data:

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Claude Analytics: Clear History"
3. Select a cutoff date
4. Confirm deletion

This is useful if you want to reset your stats or remove data from a specific period.

### Backfill from Claude.ai Export (Optional)

Want to import your full Claude.ai conversation history? You can backfill data from a Claude.ai data export:

1. Export your data from [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) (Settings > Account > Export Data)
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file
3. Run the included Python script:

```bash
python backfill_claude_export.py "path/to/data-export-folder"
```

This imports:
- Daily message counts and estimated token usage
- Estimated API-equivalent costs
- **Code blocks and lines of code** (with language breakdown)
- Personality analysis (questions, please/thanks, etc.)
- Activity patterns (peak hours, night owl/early bird scores)
- Claude thinking time analytics
- User active time estimates

**Why backfill?** The extension can only track code blocks and personality stats from the day you install it. Running the backfill script imports your complete history from Claude.ai, giving you accurate lifetime statistics.

See the backfill section in the extension's dashboard for detailed instructions.

---

## External Usage Data (Copilot, Forge, etc.)

Import usage data from any external AI tool into your analytics dashboard. Create a JSON file at `~/.claude/external-additions.json`:

```json
{
  "source": "copilot-cli",
  "lastUpdated": "2026-04-09T12:00:00Z",
  "rows": [
    { "date": "2026-04-01", "cost": 1.23, "messages": 15, "tokens": 50000, "sessions": 3 }
  ],
  "modelRows": [
    {
      "date": "2026-04-01",
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
      "input_tokens": 30000,
      "output_tokens": 10000,
      "cache_read_tokens": 8000,
      "cache_write_tokens": 2000
    }
  ]
}
```

External data merges seamlessly into all dashboard views, streaks, and lifetime totals. The JSON file is the source of truth and is re-loaded on every VS Code restart.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `source` | Yes | Identifier for the data source (e.g., "copilot-cli") |
| `rows` | Yes | Daily aggregate usage data |
| `modelRows` | No | Per-model token breakdown for accurate cost calculation |

## GitHub Gist Backup

Sync your analytics data across multiple machines using GitHub Gist.

### Setup

1. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a descriptive name like "Claude Analytics Backup"
   - Select the `gist` scope (allows creating and updating Gists)
   - Click "Generate token" and copy it immediately

2. **Configure the Extension:**
   - Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`)
   - Search for "Claude Usage Gist"
   - Enable `Gist Sync: Enabled`
   - Paste your token in `Gist Sync: Token`
   - (Optional) Set a specific Gist ID if syncing to an existing Gist

3. **Sync Options:**
   - **Auto-sync**: Enabled by default when Gist sync is enabled - automatically syncs on each data update
   - **Manual sync**: Run "Claude Analytics: Sync to Gist" command from Command Palette
   - **Import**: Run "Claude Analytics: Import from Gist" to restore data from a backup

### Multi-Machine Setup

1. Set up Gist sync on your primary machine (this creates the Gist automatically)
2. Open VS Code Settings and copy the `Gist Sync: Gist Id` value
3. On secondary machines:
   - Configure with the same token
   - Paste the Gist ID
   - Run "Claude Analytics: Import from Gist" to sync historical data

### Security Notes

- Your token is stored in VS Code user settings (not workspace settings)
- Gists are created as **private** by default
- The database contains only usage statistics - no conversation content
- Never share your Personal Access Token

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why don't I see any data?
Ensure Claude Code CLI is installed and you've used it at least once. The extension reads from `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` which is created after your first Claude Code session.

### How accurate are the cost calculations?
Costs use model-specific pricing from [modelPricing.json](modelPricing.json):
- **Claude Opus 4.6 / 4.5**: $5/1M input, $25/1M output, $6.25/1M cache write, $0.50/1M cache read
- **Claude Opus 4.1 / 4 / 3**: $15/1M input, $75/1M output, $18.75/1M cache write, $1.50/1M cache read
- **Claude Sonnet (all versions)**: $3/1M input, $15/1M output, $3.75/1M cache write, $0.30/1M cache read
- **Claude Haiku 4.5**: $1/1M input, $5/1M output, $1.25/1M cache write, $0.10/1M cache read
- **Claude Haiku 3.5**: $0.80/1M input, $4/1M output, $1/1M cache write, $0.08/1M cache read
- **Claude Haiku 3**: $0.25/1M input, $1.25/1M output

Today's cost is calculated in real-time from conversation files for maximum accuracy.

### Why does the subscription widget show "N/A"?
Claude Code credentials may not be found. Ensure you're authenticated with `claude auth login`.

### How often does data refresh?
- **Automatic**: Every 2 minutes
- **Manual**: Click refresh button or press `Ctrl+Alt+R`

### Why does "Today's" usage show $0.00 when I'm actively using Claude?
The extension reads from Claude Code's cache file (`~/.claude/stats-cache.json`), which Claude Code updates periodically - **not in real-time**. Your current session data won't appear until Claude Code writes to the cache.

**To force a cache update:**
1. End your current Claude Code session (close the terminal or run `/exit`)
2. Start a new session - this typically triggers a cache write
3. Alternatively, wait for Claude Code's automatic cache update (varies by activity)

The extension does calculate real-time today's cost by reading conversation JSONL files directly, but token counts and message stats rely on the cache.

### Is my data sent anywhere?
No. All analysis happens locally. There are no network calls — the extension operates fully offline.

### Can I use this without Claude Code CLI?
No. This extension specifically reads Claude Code's local statistics files. It's designed as a companion tool for Claude Code users.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Status bar shows "Claude" but no statistics

1. Verify Claude Code is installed: `claude --version`
2. Check authentication: `claude auth status`
3. Confirm stats file exists: `ls ~/.claude/stats-cache.json`
4. Try using Claude Code once to generate initial data

### Subscription shows "N/A"

1. Re-authenticate: `claude auth login`
2. Restart VS Code
3. Check credentials file exists: `ls ~/.claude/.credentials.json`

### Dashboard not loading

1. Try the refresh command: `Ctrl+Alt+R`
2. Reload VS Code window: `Ctrl+Shift+P` > "Reload Window"
3. Check for extension errors in Developer Tools: `Ctrl+Shift+I`

### Personality stats seem wrong

Personality analysis requires conversation history in `~/.claude/projects/`. If you recently cleared your history or are using a new machine, stats will rebuild over time.
